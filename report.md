        5. **Nondisclosure Agreements:**
            - Have non-disclosure agreements handy for employees, suppliers, contractors, or any third party that comes into contact with your proprietary information. This reduces the risk of your professional secrets being leaked to the public or rivals.


        6. **Regular Monitoring:**
            - Set up regular monitoring of the use of your intellectual property. Entities like brand monitoring services or IP law firms can help you here. Regular monitoring of the marketplace can help identify any breaches of your IP rights earlier rather than later.


        7. **IP Infringement Action Plan:**
            - Ensure you have an action plan in place in case you encounter any infringement of your IP rights. Be ready to send out cease and desist letters and file lawsuits if necessary. Legal action can help protect your IP rights and compensate for any damages suffered.


#Mobile Horticulture Classes

Combine your horticulture knowledge, people skills, and access to a car to offer mobile horticulture classes. You could travel to clients' locations to offer in-person lessons on horticulture practices. For broader outreach and to keep risk low, you could also design some classes in an online format. This idea would be particularly attractive if there's a demand for novice gardeners and other interested individuals who'd like to learn from a professional like you.
